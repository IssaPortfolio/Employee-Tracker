# Employee-Tracker
 
### The employee tracker app kicks off with a screen displaying roles like software engineers or HR, each with its own image. Users can pick a role, leading them to a detailed page showing the current employee count and individual info. The app simplifies management by allowing users to easily add or remove employees in the selected role, making workforce tracking straightforward. Additionally, there is a button that when clicked, will display all the employees at once, allowing users to efficiently edit information for the entire workforce.
